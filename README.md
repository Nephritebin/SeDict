## SeDict: Search your unknown words in an essay automatically.

This project is going to help you generate a pdf file automatically with a input english essay, fiction or just a sentence. The pdf file will contain the unknown words in the sentence with their meanings and examples from high-quality English-English dictionary. We hope that this project will help you to improve your English skills and save your time for English intensive reading exercises.

We use the [COCA]() dataset to check the frequency of the words, and then filter the high frequency words in default. You can also set the frequency threshold or the filtering algorithm by yourself.
